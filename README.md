# QuestKeeper

QuestKeeper is a full-stack reference companion for the **2014 version of Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition**. It gives players one searchable interface for classes, races, spells, and backgrounds instead of making them jump between reference pages.

## Features

- Global search across classes, races, spells, and backgrounds.
- Dedicated category browsing pages.
- Selectable result cards with an in-page detail panel.
- Guided character creation wizard (race, class, background, ability scores, class skill choices) that derives real starting stats instead of flat defaults.
- A full character sheet with directly editable core stats, ability scores, and skills (all 18, with computed modifiers).
- Level-up flow with hit points, ability score improvements or feats, and spell learning.
- Manual tracking for equipment, attacks, feats, spells (with per-level spell slots), and per-rest limited-use resources — all editable after creation, not just at creation time.
- Loading, empty, and error feedback for API-driven views.
- Responsive navigation and a mobile result-to-detail flow.
- Reusable React components for search, cards, navigation, details, and editable list sections.

## Tech stack

| Area       | Technology                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | React 19, React Router, Vite, CSS |
| Backend    | Node.js, Express, REST routes     |
| Testing    | Vitest                            |
| Data       | D&D 5e SRD API (2014 endpoints)   |
| Repository | npm workspaces monorepo           |

The project is being developed incrementally toward accounts, saved content, and further gameplay tracking. Character sheets (creation, leveling, and full manual editing) are already built and stored locally per browser. For the complete product direction, content policy, and development milestones, see [QuestKeeper Project Vision](docs/QUESTKEEPER_VISION.md).

## Current implementation

QuestKeeper currently includes:

- A React and Vite frontend.
- An Express backend.
- Category pages for classes, races, spells, and backgrounds.
- Global search across the available categories.
- Detail panels for individual results.
- A guided character creation wizard and a full character sheet page, covering stats, skills, spellcasting (including spell slots), attacks, equipment, feats, resources, and a companion/notes area — all directly editable after creation.
- A level-up flow for existing characters (hit points, ability score improvements or feats, new spells).
- A backend connection to the D&D 5e SRD API's 2014 endpoints.
- Root npm workspace commands for running both applications from the monorepo.
- A growing Vitest suite covering the character sheet's pure game-logic functions.

QuestKeeper is actively developed, with features added incrementally so the architecture, data sources, and user experience can evolve deliberately.

```

The frontend and backend retain separate `package.json` files because they have different dependencies. The root `package.json` defines npm workspaces and convenient commands for both applications.

The applications originally lived in separate repositories. They were combined into this monorepo when features began requiring coordinated frontend and backend changes.

## How the applications communicate

```text
React frontend
    -> QuestKeeper Express backend
    -> D&D 5e SRD API (2014)
```

The frontend normally requests data from `http://localhost:3001/api`. The Express backend then requests the appropriate 2014 resource from `https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/2014` and returns it in a consistent `{ data: ... }` response.

Keeping the external API behind the QuestKeeper backend creates a place to add validation, caching, source information, normalized data, accounts, and character data later.

## Local setup

### Prerequisites

- A current Node.js version that supports the built-in `fetch` API.
- npm.
- Git.

### Install dependencies

From the repository root:

```powershell
npm install
```

### Run the backend

Open a terminal in the repository root and run:

```powershell
npm run dev:backend
```

The backend listens on:

```text
http://localhost:3001
```

### Run the frontend

Open a second terminal in the repository root and run:

```powershell
npm run dev:frontend
```

Vite will print the frontend's local URL in the terminal.

### Frontend API configuration

The frontend defaults to the local backend at `http://localhost:3001/api`. To use another backend, copy the frontend environment example and set the desired URL:

```text
questkeeper-frontend/.env.example
```

Environment variable:

```text
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

Restart the Vite development server after changing an environment variable.

## Deployment

QuestKeeper is deployed on Render:

- [Frontend demo](https://questkeeper-it0i.onrender.com)
- [Backend API](https://questkeeper-api.onrender.com)

The repository includes a [`render.yaml`](render.yaml) Blueprint that defines both services:

- `questkeeper-api`: a Node/Express web service.
- `questkeeper`: a Vite static site with a single-page app rewrite.

The deployed frontend uses `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://questkeeper-api.onrender.com/api`. The backend reads Render's host-provided `PORT`, and no API keys or secrets are required. The API currently allows cross-origin requests because it exposes only public SRD reference data; a future authenticated version should restrict allowed origins.

## Available commands

Run these commands from the repository root:

| Command                                                | Purpose                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev:frontend`                                 | Start the Vite frontend development server        |
| `npm run dev:backend`                                  | Start the Express backend with automatic restarts |
| `npm run start:backend`                                | Start the Express backend without Nodemon         |
| `npm run build`                                        | Create a production frontend build                |
| `npm run lint`                                         | Check the frontend source with ESLint             |
| `npm run test --workspace questkeeper-frontend -- run` | Run the Vitest suite once                         |

Automated tests cover the character sheet's pure functions (ability scores, hit points, level-up, resources, rests). Backend and component-level tests have not been added yet.

## Engineering decisions and challenges

### The frontend and backend began as separate repositories

**Problem:** Developing one feature could require coordinating two repositories, two histories, and separate Git workflows.

**Current solution:** Both applications were combined into this monorepo while preserving their existing files and Git history. A root workspace package now provides shared development commands, and the repository is connected to the QuestKeeper GitHub remote.

### Search required unnecessary navigation

**Problem:** The original search interaction made it harder to move directly from a query to useful results.

**Current solution:** Search submission and routing were improved so searches lead into the global results experience more naturally. Search results from all current content categories are formatted into a shared card and detail-panel interface.

### Only one background appears

**Problem:** The backgrounds page displays only Acolyte, which can look like an application or filtering error.

**Current solution:** The data path was audited. QuestKeeper does not remove any background results; the upstream 2014 SRD source contains only Acolyte. Adding other backgrounds is therefore a content-source and licensing decision rather than a frontend bug fix.

### The character sheet needed to support real, messy, homebrew characters

**Problem:** A guided creation wizard tied to SRD data works well for starting a new character, but real, actively-played characters accumulate content the SRD doesn't have — homebrew magic items, DM-granted resources, non-SRD feats — and need every stat editable as the character changes, not just at creation.

**Current solution:** The character sheet page supports direct editing of every core stat, plus freeform (non-SRD-linked) add/edit/remove for equipment, attacks, feats, and spells, each with an optional multi-line notes field rendered as bullet points. A generic `EditableItemList` component backs four of those sections so the same add/edit/remove/confirm-before-delete behavior isn't reimplemented per section.

### Public D&D websites contain content that may not be reusable

**Problem:** Material being publicly readable does not automatically mean QuestKeeper may copy and redistribute it. Attribution alone does not grant that permission.

**Current solution:** QuestKeeper will use content only after reviewing its source, edition, coverage, license, and terms. It will not use Wikidot or similar websites as an unverified database. The project may instead use reusable material, original explanations, authorized external links, and private user-entered notes.

### Local and deployed environments need different backend URLs

**Problem:** The local frontend expects a backend on `localhost`, which will not work for a publicly deployed frontend.

**Current solution:** The frontend supports `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. In local development, it defaults to `http://localhost:3001/api`. The deployed Render frontend is configured to use `https://questkeeper-api.onrender.com/api`, allowing the same frontend codebase to work correctly in both local and production environments.

## Known limitations

- Content is limited to what the current 2014 SRD API provides.
- Background coverage currently includes only Acolyte (freeform manual entry works around this for an individual character, but the browsable Backgrounds page is still SRD-limited).
- Source, edition, license, and attribution metadata are not yet shown for individual entries.
- Global search depends on all category requests succeeding together.
- Upstream requests do not yet use application-level caching or explicit timeouts.
- Character sheets are stored in the browser's local storage only — there are no accounts or cross-device sync yet.
- Equipment/proficiency _choices_ (e.g. "a martial weapon or two simple weapons") aren't modeled during guided creation; only guaranteed starting gear is, plus freeform manual entry for anything else.
- Test coverage is limited to the frontend's pure game-logic functions — no backend or component/UI tests yet.
- The free backend service may take approximately a minute to wake after a period of inactivity.

## Planned development

The current high-level sequence is:

1. Keep the architecture, vision, setup, and content policies documented.
2. Grant starting spells automatically at character creation for casters, and model equipment/proficiency choices during guided creation (both currently require a manual workaround).
3. Improve search and browsing for approved reusable data, and add more legally-sourced content (e.g. the 2024 SRD's additional backgrounds and feats).
4. Add normalized backend models, source provenance, response validation, caching, and timeouts.
5. Expand automated test coverage to the backend and to UI components, not just pure functions.
6. Add accounts, favorites, and cross-device saved content (character sheets currently live in localStorage only).
7. Add richer companion/mount tracking (currently a freeform text field) and a dedicated attacks/weapons-focused layout pass.
8. Explore AI-assisted character recommendations after the underlying rules and character data are reliable.

The roadmap is intentionally incremental. Each feature should be small enough to understand, implement, test, and review before moving to the next one.

## Content and licensing principles

QuestKeeper targets the 2014 rules, but it should not silently mix editions or reproduce protected material without permission.

When adding a source, document:

- Its rules edition.
- Who provides it.
- What original material it uses.
- Its license and attribution requirements.
- Which categories and books it covers.
- Whether QuestKeeper may reproduce the text, link to it, or store only private user notes.

The detailed policy and proposed provenance fields are recorded in [docs/QUESTKEEPER_VISION.md](docs/QUESTKEEPER_VISION.md).
